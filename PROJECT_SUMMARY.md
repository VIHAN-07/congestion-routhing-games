# Congestion Routing Game - Complete Implementation Summary

## üìÑ Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive computational framework for modeling and analyzing congestion routing games, addressing fundamental challenges in multi-agent systems where strategic decision-making under congestion externalities leads to suboptimal equilibrium outcomes. Congestion games constitute a critical class of problems in algorithmic game theory, with applications spanning transportation networks, telecommunications, and distributed computing systems. The primary contribution of this work is the development of an integrated platform that combines exact analytical methods with scalable approximation algorithms to compute Nash equilibria in congestion routing scenarios of varying complexity. Our implementation addresses the critical challenge of understanding equilibrium outcomes in multi-agent routing scenarios where individual choices create externalities affecting overall system performance, providing both theoretical insights and practical tools for analyzing complex routing decisions in real-world networks.

The congestion routing game models scenarios where n strategic agents must independently choose among k available routes to reach their destinations, where each route's cost increases as a function of the number of agents selecting it. Formally, if xi agents choose route i, each agent on that route incurs cost ci(xi), where ci is a non-decreasing congestion function representing realistic congestion effects. This creates negative externalities characteristic of congestion phenomena, where individual rational choices may result in collectively suboptimal outcomes. The game's payoff structure creates strategic interdependence where an agent's optimal choice depends on the decisions of all other agents, leading to complex equilibrium dynamics. Our implementation accommodates both linear and polynomial congestion functions commonly observed in traffic networks, data centers, and supply chain systems, enabling the analysis of diverse real-world scenarios including traffic flow optimization, data center load balancing, and supply chain routing.

The methodological approach employs multiple sophisticated strategies for equilibrium computation and analysis, ranging from exact analytical solutions to advanced learning algorithms. For two-agent games, we implement exact Nash equilibrium computation using the nashpy library with support enumeration algorithms that guarantee finding all pure and mixed strategy equilibria, providing mathematical precision for smaller games and validation for approximate methods. For larger games, iterative best response dynamics enable agents to sequentially update strategies by selecting optimal responses to current opponent strategies, typically converging to pure strategy Nash equilibria when they exist. The fictitious play algorithm simulates long-term learning behavior where agents maintain beliefs about opponent strategies based on historical observations, converging to mixed strategy equilibria that capture realistic bounded rationality. Advanced methods include evolutionary game theory through replicator dynamics to model population-level strategy evolution, reinforcement learning algorithms using Q-learning for adaptive strategy selection, regret minimization techniques guaranteeing convergence to correlated equilibria, and mechanism design tools including Pigouvian taxes and subsidies to improve system efficiency by aligning individual incentives with social welfare optimization.

The implementation leverages a robust technology stack optimized for computational game theory applications, with Python 3.11 providing the foundation and NumPy enabling efficient numerical computation and matrix operations essential for payoff calculations. The nashpy library facilitates exact Nash equilibrium computation for two-player games using state-of-the-art algorithms, while SciPy provides optimization routines for social welfare maximization and constrained equilibrium computation. Custom algorithms handle large-scale games where exact enumeration becomes computationally intractable, with memory-efficient implementations scaling to games with 20+ agents and heuristic methods providing approximate solutions for larger instances. The visualization system built on Matplotlib generates comprehensive charts including equilibrium strategy distributions, learning convergence plots, and comparative analysis diagrams, automatically saving plots for documentation and presentation purposes. The implementation follows object-oriented design principles with modular architecture enabling easy extension and maintenance, comprehensive error handling ensuring robustness across different game configurations, and performance optimization including complexity analysis and benchmarking tools for evaluation.
